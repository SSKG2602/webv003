        <li>Pamela’s work spans medical devices, XR environments, cloud platforms, and AI-native systems—each built from scratch with a focus on trust, clarity, and human-centered execution.</li>
        <li>With a background in Embodied Cognitive Science and Human–AI Interaction, her systems mirror how people perceive, adapt, and decide. Instead of wrapping interfaces around AI, she designs intelligence that behaves like a partner—structured, stable, and intuitive.</li>
        <li>At Dasein, she brings that craft into the next frontier: architecting agentic systems that stay observable, steerable, and aligned with people from day one.</li>
        <li>Beliefs that drive the work: Human-in-the-loop is structural. Transparency is the foundation. Structure determines trust.</li>
        <li>NSF Bioengineering Fellow. Developer for NYU Medical College. Instructor in MIT-aligned spaces. Improv-trained with Second City.</li>
        <li>This work is personal. Dasein exists to prove that intelligent systems can be both powerful and respectful—at the same time.</li>
